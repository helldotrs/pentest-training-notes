variable types:
    let/var/const 
        var is original type. best to use let instead.

main data types: 
    num/string/bool
        is int called num in js???

is there any valid usecase for == instead of ===??
or ** instead of **=

funcitons:
    if they look like right
        function my_fun(a, b){
    it is es5

    if they look ridicolus
        const my_fun = (a, b) => {
    it is es6 (most popular js version)
    I mean I can see merit to saving a funciton in a const but.... it looks konstigt (pun intended)   

square brackets [] for array

loops:
    while
    for         // legacy style: for(i = 0; i >= 10; i++){
    do...while  // damn thats a dumb name
