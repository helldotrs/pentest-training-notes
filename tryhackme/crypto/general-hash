hash collisions
  pidgin hole effect
  
  MD5 and SHA1 have been attacked, and made technically insecure due to engineering hash collisions. However, no attack has yet given a collision in both algorithms at the same time so if you use the MD5 hash AND the SHA1 hash to compare, you will see theyâ€™re different. The MD5 collision example is available from https://www.mscs.dal.ca/~selinger/md5collision/ and details of the SHA1 Collision are available from https://shattered.io/. Due to these, you shouldn't trust either algorithm for hashing passwords or data.
