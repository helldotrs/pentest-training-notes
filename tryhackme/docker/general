    pull (we have done this above!)
    ls (list images)
    rm (remove an image)
    build (we will come onto this in the “Building your First Container” task)

docker pull ubuntu:22.04
docker image ls
docker image rm ubuntu:22.04
pocker ps lists running contailers -a flag to also list non running

-d detached mode
-it [i]nteractive, t to run shell within contaner ([t]erminal?)
-v [v]olume. "tells Docker to mount a directory or file from the host operating system to a location within the container. The location these files get stored is defined in the Dockerfile" (/results/ in tla?)
-p bind [p]ort
-rm [r]e[m]ove container once finished running
-name name the container (default is two random words)

single service:
" Containers do not have service managers like systemd (this is by design - it is bad practice to run multiple applications in the same container. For example, this container is for the apache2 web server - and the apache2 web server only)."

chaining commands to decrease layers (apparently a good practice? it looks bad, and that you prioritize hardware over dev-time/readability):
    Before:    
        FROM ubuntu:latest
        RUN apt-get update -y
        RUN apt-get upgrade -y
        RUN apt-get install apache2 -y
        RUN apt-get install net-tools -y
    After:    
        FROM ubuntu:latest
        RUN apt-get update -y && apt-get upgrade -y && apt-get install apache2 -y && apt-get install net-tools
