Ping uses ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) 

ARP - Address Resolution Protocol 
        is responsible for finding the MAC (hardware) address related to a specific IP address. It works by broadcasting an ARP query, "Who has this IP address? Tell me." And the response is of the form, "The IP address is at this MAC address."
