TCP header flags:
    URG - Urgent
    ACK - Acknowledgement
    PSH - Push
    RST - Reset
    SYN - Synchronize
    Fin - Finish

Below is a quick summary of the command-line options for Nmap that we have covered.
    Scan Type 	                Example Command
    ARP Scan 	                sudo nmap -PR -sn MACHINE_IP/24
    ICMP Echo Scan 	            sudo nmap -PE -sn MACHINE_IP/24
    ICMP Timestamp Scan 	    sudo nmap -PP -sn MACHINE_IP/24
    ICMP Address Mask Scan 	    sudo nmap -PM -sn MACHINE_IP/24
    TCP SYN Ping Scan 	        sudo nmap -PS22,80,443 -sn MACHINE_IP/30
    TCP ACK Ping Scan 	        sudo nmap -PA22,80,443 -sn MACHINE_IP/30
    UDP Ping Scan 	            sudo nmap -PU53,161,162 -sn MACHINE_IP/30

Remember to add -sn if you are only interested in host discovery without port-scanning. Omitting -sn will let Nmap default to port-scanning the live hosts.
    Option 	    Purpose
    -n 	        no DNS lookup
    -R 	        reverse-DNS lookup for all hosts
    -sn 	    host discovery only

timing
    You can control the scan timing using -T<0-5>. -T0 is the slowest (paranoid), while -T5 is the fastest. According to Nmap manual page, there are six templates:
        paranoid (0) -slowest
        sneaky (1) -common in real engagments
        polite (2)
        normal (3) -default
        aggressive (4) -common in ctf/learning
        insane (5) -fastest
    the slower the less likely to get ids detection (I would think randomness would add to this factor as well)

    Alternatively, you can choose to control the packet rate using --min-rate <number> and --max-rate <number>. For example, --max-rate 10 or --max-rate=10 ensures that your scanner is not sending more than ten packets per second. 

probing parallelization
    Moreover, you can control probing parallelization using --min-parallelism <numprobes> and --max-parallelism <numprobes>. Nmap probes the targets to discover which hosts are live and which ports are open; probing parallelization specifies the number of such probes that can be run in parallel. For instance, --min-parallelism=512 pushes Nmap to maintain at least 512 probes in parallel; these 512 probes are related to host discovery and open ports.

summary
    This room covered three types of scans.
        Port Scan Type 	    Example Command
        TCP Connect Scan 	nmap -sT 10.10.68.198
        TCP SYN Scan 	    sudo nmap -sS 10.10.68.198
        UDP Scan 	        sudo nmap -sU 10.10.68.198
    
    These scan types should get you started discovering running TCP and UDP services on a target host.
        Option 	        Purpose
        -p- 	        all ports
        -p1-1023 	    scan ports 1 to 1023
        -F 	            100 most common ports
        -r 	            scan ports in consecutive order
        -T<0-5> 	    -T0 being the slowest and T5 the fastest
        --max-rate 50 	rate <= 50 packets/sec
        --min-rate 15 	rate >= 15 packets/sec
--min-parallelism 100 	at least 100 probes in parallel
