what is the scans:
    ARP scan: This scan uses ARP requests to discover live hosts
        ARP scan is possible only if you are on the same subnet as the target systems
    ICMP scan: This scan uses ICMP requests to identify live hosts (ping/similar?)
    TCP/UDP ping scan: This scan sends packets to TCP ports and UDP ports to determine live hosts.

scanners:
    arp-scan
    masscan

ARP from Link Layer
    ARP has one purpose: sending a frame to the broadcast address on the network segment and asking the computer with a specific IP address to respond by providing its MAC address.
ICMP from Network Layer
    ICMP has many types. ICMP ping uses Type 8 (Echo) and Type 0 (Echo Reply).
TCP from Transport Layer
UDP from Transport Layer

flags:
    -sn    :    ping scan    :    Disable port scanning. Host discovery only.
