command injection != remote code execution (RCE)

rce - end result
command injection - a way to achive rce

make app run command on host os with same privledge as the user who runs the app

one of the most lucrative attacks 

blind vs verbose ci

whoami - good test/proof of concept? (poc?) (for verbose)

detecting blindv
    delay (sleep/ping etc)
    force output (example: whoami > output.txt && cat output.txt)
