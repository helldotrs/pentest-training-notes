"A good practice would be to compare executables on this list with GTFOBins (https://gtfobins.github.io). Clicking on the SUID button will filter binaries known to be exploitable when the SUID bit is set (you can also use this link for a pre-filtered list https://gtfobins.github.io/#+suid)."
--> automate?
