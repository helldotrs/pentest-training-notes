nc -lvnp <port-number>

    -l is used to tell netcat that this will be a listener
    -v is used to request a verbose output
    -n tells netcat not to resolve host names or use DNS. Explaining this is outwith the scope of the room.
    -p indicates that the port specification will follow.
posts below 1024 needs sudo to listen on, but wellknown ports are more likely to get past firewalls 

bind shell:
nc *ip* *port*
